<p class="quote">Eclipse Systems is a UK-based software development company with offices in Liss and and in the near future Canary Wharf, London.</p>
<p class="quote">Our skilled and proficient staff deliver work of very high quality, and can help you no matter what stage you are at in developing your software.</p>
<p class="quote">We are highly committed to client satisfaction, and this motivates everything we do.</p>

<p><span class="SubTitle">Client Focused</span><br /> Eclipse Systems offers a fully comprehensive service to our customers, from initial project feasibility and estimation
studies, initial design phases, through development and deployment and ending with on-going support. We are able to handle complete projects by having a comprehensive set
of skills in-house and by being able to make use of partnerships with trusted third-parties such as security experts, specialist hardware designers, etc, when needed. Our
Project Mangers are well versed in running projects smoothly and efficiently with the objective of providing a high quality solution at a competitive price. Another key
aspect of our Project Managers is their ability to identify risk in projects and taking steps to ameliorate those risks</p>

<p>We have many years' experience over a large range of markets and technologies, but we are also continually pushing forward in the adoption of new technologies to ensure our
clients have access to the most advanced technologies. It is because of this enthusiastic attitude, thorough technical knowledge, and extensive experience that we are able
to deliver the most challenging of projects in the most efficient and timely manner.</p>

<p>Because of our confidence in our teams' abilities we are willing to undertake work on a <strong>fixed-cost, fixed-timescale basis</strong> - this allows our customers to
be confident of what they will be getting, when they will receive it and what the cost will be. This allows our customers to manage their budgets and plan their IT strategies
with confidence. In a world where IT projects are notorious for running late and over budget we can offer our customers complete reassurance.</p>

<p>In summary, we offer real value for money. We are confident that the services we offer match those of the biggest and most well-known names in the business but at far lower
cost than they would charge.</p>

<p>Our track record has earned us both a highly respected reputation and a loyal customer base who trust and return to us when new solutions are needed.</p>

<p><span class="SubTitle">Employee Satisfaction</span><br /><img class="alignright size-244x326 wp-image-4586"

	width="244" height="182" />It is our belief that to achieve the levels of customer satisfaction that we aim for we also need to achieve high levels of employee
satisfaction.</p>
<p><span class="BodyText">We recruit highly able applicants as software developers who we then go on to train t</span>hem ourselves. Most are <strong>highly able and
motivated</strong> graduates from leading universities, although this is not to say that we are blind to talent from elsewhere.</p>

<p>We provide a first class working environment for our employees and engage them with interesting and challenging work. We provide ongoing training and mentoring allied with an
excellent renumeration package including a generous profit sharing scheme.</p>

<p>Because of this approach, we have built up a solid team of enthusiastic, well-motivated and experienced software developers and consultants with a very
low level of staff turnover. This benefits Eclipse Systems as we get a high return on our investment in our employees but equally benefits our customers who receive service
with unrivalled continuity and of the highest standard.</p>
