<h1>Business Analysis</h1>
<p>In today's competitive world companies must always be at their best, maintain an edge, and capitalise on opportunities for growth. Business analysis is a deliberate attempt to review
operations to ensure that business is moving along as well as it can and that the company is taking advantage of opportunities.</p>

<p>Basically, business analysis is a set of tasks and activities that help companies determine their objectives for meeting certain oppotunities or addressing challenges and then help
them define solutions to meet those objectives.</p>

<h2>Defining Business Analysis</h2>
<p>According to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK version 2), business analysis is the "set of tasks and techniques used to work as a liaison among stakeholders in order
to understand the structure, policies, and operations of an organisation, and to recommend solutions that enable the organisation to achieve its goals."</P>

<p>In simpler terms the aim of a BA is to understand how companies work and to enable companies to reach their potential by helping them articualate and meet goals, recognise and
take advantage of opportunities, or identify and overcome challenges. All of which is a pretty tall order. But the task becomes more manageable - and understandable - if you think
of it as having two distinct parts: the <strong>goal</strong> and the <strong>process</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The goal addresses why you're doing the analysis in the first place - perhaps to improve a company's revenue and services or to reduce costs. Think of the goal as the purpose
of the project. In order to determine what the real goal is you often have to employ the most frequently asked question in the world of business analysis: <strong>"Why?"</strong>.
Often the process just comes down to repeatedly asking "why?" until the root of the issue is discovered.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>The process involves understanding the how - that is, understanding what the solution needs to do, what should it look like, and the people or systems that interact with it. The
process requires you to grasp where the company is today and where it needs to be in order to achieve the goal. During this part, you determine what the solution should look and feel like
and how to make sure it's used after being developed. To develop the process, you basically break the goal down into manageable pieces that you and the company can execute. Those
manageable pieces make up the solution.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In business analysis, you do not actually peform the activites to build the solution, nor do you actually manage the process to build the solution or test
the solution. Instead, you identify the activities that enable the company to define the business problem or opportunity, define what the solution looks like, and define how it should
behave in the end. As the BA you lay out the plans for the process ahead.</p>
