    <h2>Why a DECmate Is Not A PDP-8</h2>
    <p>Some notes on the DECmate by the seemingly legendary PDP-8 expert <strong>Charles Lasner</strong></p>
    <p>Subject: Why a DECmate isn't a PDP-8</p>
    <p>From : lasner@watsun.cc.columbia.edu (Charles Lasner)</p>
    <p>Date: Mon, 1 Mar 1993 18:39:56 GMT</p>
    <p>
    This newsgroup is primarily for PDP-8 family stuff, and will therefore support DECmates as well. But a DECmate isn't *quite* a PDP-8 as we know it. Certain
    problems thwart the prevailing software from running on it, and instead some "bastardized" versions have appeared (such as OS/278). This will be the
    first in a series of articles to detail the areas of incompatibility and what can be done about them.
    </p>
    <h3>
    1)	CPU issues.
    </h3>
    <p>
    The DECmate is based on the 6120 micro version of the PDP-8. It is mostly compatible, and includes the powerful extension of CP memory and
    related hardware, dual push-down stacks, etc. Certain instructions have minor differences such as the exact definitions of the PDP-8/e-originating
    superset instructions GTF and RTF. The differences are so slight that the existing software for PDP-8/e interrupt handling will just work, but certain
    diagnostic programs will likely fail on these specific points. There are differences such as:
    </p>
    <p>
    PDP-8/e RTF does not clear the AC afterwards; 6120 does. This is even a useful improvement as there is no software reason not to clear the AC at
    that point. (The AC is being loaded from a temporary to restore the former status saved during an interrupt. Then the AC has to be loaded with the
    former AC value, thus a CLA after RTF is in all practical 8/e code. The RTF performing its own clear thus allows a 6120-only interrupt handler that
    is shorter/faster.)
    </p>
    <p>
    PDP-8/e GTF reads back the state of interrupt into bit[4]. PDP-8/e RTF ignores bit[4] and re-enables the interrupt. 6120 GTF reads back a one into
    bit[4]. 6120 RTF loads interrupt enable per AC[4]. For normal interrupt handling for PDP-8/e, this sequence is essentially compatible enough. Note
    that classic PDP-8 interrupt handling is totally compatible on all models, but that there are PDP-8/e and newer interrupt routines, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    The use of extended memory instructions on the PDP-8/e is compatible with former processors, but can be extended via the KT8A or CESI MEC8 extensions.
    The 6120 is only compatible with the subset found on the PDP-8/e without those extensions because other instructions have been assigned to the same
    IOTs. These include new instructions such as GCF (Get Current Fields) which is essentially the non-interrupt-oriented version of GTF, etc., and a set of
    instructions only valid in CP memory to handle that section. Some of the instructions are defined for CP memory trap, and others are for manipulating
    the built-in dual stack.
    </p>
    <p>
    As long as the program sticks to the compatible subset found in a 32K PDP-8/e, the instructions are otherwise compatible.
    </p>
    <h3>
    2)	Console issues.
    </h3>
    <p>
    On I/O, the 6120 largely parts company with the PDP-8/e. The actual implementation of I/O on the DECmate consists of using packaged interfaces
    usually called "pie" chips (or Programmed Interface Elements). The problem with these chips is that they are only *almost* compatible with existing
    PDP-8 interfaces whereas the prevailing OSes demand *total* compatibility with the older hardware. There are several internal interfaces within the
    DECmate for particular use of no concern to the OS, and this is not at issue, such as the internal interface for the keyboard which is actually on an
    additional serial port (bidirectionally) or the APU/XPU interface, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    PDP-8 compatibility demands that the device 03/04 instructions be truly compatible. On the 6121 PIE chip, liberties were taken with the design that
    cause out-and-out incompatibility such that only trivial programming examples still work, while the actual usage within the operating system is totally
    incompatible. A breakdown of the console instructions:
    </p>
    <p>
    6030	Clear the keyboard flag, do not advance the reader if a TTY: is the console device, do not clear the AC. The 6120 version of this is to
      *set* the flag! (This instruction is not used on earlier models, so compatibility issues aren't as bad as it sounds!)
    </p>
    <p>
    6031	Skip on the keyboard flag. Notably, the PDP-8 convention is that this instruction work *precisely* as stated. Specifically, 6031
      must skip if the flag is set. Repeating the instruction must repeat the same effect. On the 6120, 6031 executes as skip on *and clear*
      the flag, thus 6031 when repeated is totally incompatible, because the flag won't raise until the data is read. PDP-8 OS compatibility
      demands that the 6031 repeat facility be present. Without this, various programs, handlers, and all BATCH operations are incompatible.
      OS/278 consists of a bunch of wimpy emasculated versions of cusps that either don't work properly, have existing bugs to be fixed, or kludges
      to create the perception of ^C and/or ^S/^Q handling being present correctly, but in point of fact, it is 100% deficient in this area.
      When OS/278 is run on an actual PDP-8, it behaves as poorly since it can't take advantage of the proper console interface, instead sticking
      to the subset where 6031 cannot skip repeatedly, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    6032	Clear the AC, advance reader run if a TTY: console, clear the keyboard flag. On the 6120, 6032 merely clears the AC. Since 6031 clears the
      flag, they didn't bother to make 6032 accomplish it. However, 6032 on the 6120 will allow the flag to raise for the *next* character since
      the interface is both buffered and simulated. Due to hardware limitations of the DECmate, it is not possible to re-implement the
      simulated console interface any better than currently provided. The base reason for this is that only the "even" IOT's are trapped and
      emulated while the "odd" IOT's are allowed to be used in hardware. Had the entire interface been trapped, we could emulate the compatible
      version!
    </p>
    <p>
    6033	NOP This IOT is essentially reserved for situations where the interface baud rate could be programmed, but doesn't apply in the case
      of either the PDP-8 or the DECmate.
    </p>
    <p>
    6034	Read the latest character, do not disturb the flag. The data is logically ORed into the AC. This is used to notice that the data
      is a ^C or other character without disturbing the flag, so that other software can check it again, after being swapped in. (It's used in
      conjunction with 6031 which doesn't clear the flag when it skips.) The 6120 version of this instruction is to OR into the AC the *previously
      read* character provided by either 6032 or 6036, but it cannot initiate a new character by itself. While it is of marginal utility to be able
      to re-read a previously read character, the inability to read in the latest character without disturbing the flag is the crux of the
      compatibility issue.
    </p>
    <p>
    6035	Load interrupt enable for devices 03/04 per AC[11]. On the 6120 this is changed to device 03 only. The 04 function is handled by 6045.
      Since this is a PDP-8/e instruction, it is not a serious compatibility issue except for initialization routines that use interrupts. However,
      since the keyboard is emulated on the DECmate, interrupt timings may prove "choppy" compared to a real PDP-8, and interrupts to the console
      are not recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
    6036	LOAD the AC with the latest character and clear the flag. Also enable reader run if the console is a TTY:. Essentially this is the OR of
      6032 and 6034. The 6120 still ORs together the two operations, but the underlying two operations aren't compatible, since the flag is
      unaffected. However, reading the character will cause the next character's flag to raise (when available). If 6032 or 6036 is not
      executed, then the flag will *never* raise even if the user pounds on the keyboard! (There is an OS/278 ODT bug related to this which is
      fixable per se, but not the ^C handling as described above.)
    </p>
    <p>
    6037	NOP
    </p>
    <p>
    6040	Set the output flag. Actually compatible on 6120! (And not needed for compatibility with earlier machines that didn't have it.)
    </p>
    <p>
    6041	Skip on output flag. Like the input flag, the 6120 also clears the flag when issuing 6041. There is less of a compatibility issue since
      it is possible to write code that doesn't depend on the second skip, as long as you time out the flag in any initialization code. (P?S/8
      has always done this in the past; OS/8 tends to not overlap the console I/O so therefore the skip on flag gets checked after outputting
      not before, so this is good enough for most routines.)
    </p>
    <p>
    6042	Clear the output flag. On the 6120 it clears the AC. Usually the AC contents is unimportant during 6042, so not a serious compatibility
      issue, but diagnostics will fail.
    </p>
    <p>
    6043	NOP
    </p>
    <p>
    6044	Output the character, do not clear the flag. Same on 6120, but since the output routine is emulated, the flag will immediately be up when
      the program is running after the trap. On a real PDP-8, the flag comes up one character time later after it's actually sent, not
      immediately. This could affect some interrupt routines. Again, interrupt handling of the console is not recommended on the DECmate, 
      especially on the output side.
    </p>
    <p>
    6045	On the PDP-8/e, this is skip on input OR output flag raised AND interrupt enable in the device. Useful to cause interrupt polling
      routines that have to favor other devices to have less overhead. If the device actually has the flag raised, then you have to do a few
      extra instructions, but when the interrupt is elsewhere, it lowers the latency. On the 6120, this is replaced with load interrupt
      enable for device 04 only per AC[11]. Since this is an extension beyond the basic interface, this is a compatibility issue for
      interrupt-driven PDP-8/e and newer routines only.
    </p>
    <p>
    6046	Output the character and clear the flag now, causing it to raise later. On the 6120, the instruction is trapped, so the net result
      is to raise the flag when the trap handling is over and execution resumes. Causes interrupt routines to always be entered and no
      background processing to occur during the simulated interrupt handling, which is not recommended. Non-interrupt programming is
      not affected by this aspect of compatibility however.
    </p>
    <p>
    6047	NOP
    </p>
    <p>
    So, in summary, console handling is severely incompatible with regard to keyboard handling, and moderately incompatible for screen handling, most
    notably in regard to either flag initialization and/or interrupt handling.  Yet, simple-minded examples from Introduction to Programming will more-or-less
    work; "live" OS routines cannot work. I am working on a replacement system to be known as OS/8 Version 5, which will work within the available subset
    and thus will run on all models. However, existing OS/8 cannot work on the DECmates, and OS/278 cannot perform many functions found in OS/8.

    This is the second in a series of posts about why the DECmate series of small computers is not quite what we know as a PDP-8. Part one dealt with
    the few minor CPU issues and detailed the significant differences in the console interfaces between all PDP-8 (and VT-78) models and the DECmates.
    </p>
    <p>
    2a)	Consequences of the console problems and what to do about them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Since the console interface is hopelessly "mangled" we have to learn to live with it. Existing PDP-8 programs designed for the various OSes will
    have to be either supported as is or be changed for DECmate and PDP-8 use.
    </p>
    <p>
    P?S/8 has already undergone a console "overhaul" such that all system programs can now be run on any model of PDP-8, VT-78, PDP-12, or DECmate. (The family
    of 8 rule applied to P?S/8 as well as OS/8, thus neither will run on a PDP-5 or PDP-8/s.) To accomplish a compatible console interface compromise, the
    following rules were laid down:
    </p>
    <p>
    If a program is meant to strictly run on a PDP-8 or VT-78 only, then it can assume the old-style console interface exists. Thus, *only* on a PDP-8
    can the following code or equivalent be used:
    </p>
    <p>
      KSF			/FLAG UP?
      JMP	NOT		/FORGET IT
      KRS			/READ IT IN NOW; DON'T DISTURB THE FLAG
      AND	(177)		/GET RID OF PARITY BIT
      TAD	(-3)		/COMPARE TO ^C
      SZA CLA			/SKIP IF IT MATCHES
      JMP	CLRIT		/JUMP IF OTHER
    /	DO WHAT'S NEEDED HERE, SUCH AS SET THE DF TO 00, ETC.
      JMP I	(7600)		/KEYBOARD MONITOR WILL NOTICE THE ^C
    
    CLRIT,	KCC			/CLEAR THE FLAG WE NOTICED ON OTHER THAN ^C
    NOT,	CLA			/CONTINUE PROCESSING; NO ^C PRESSED
    </p>
    <p>
    This code is applicable to OS/8 and P?S/8, but only on PDP-8's, not DECmates.  The changes to the keyboard monitor of either system has to still include the
    check for ^C by noticing the KSF skips, execute KRB and check if the character is ^C and take the appropriate action, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that the pre-DECmate P?S/8 and all pre-V4 OS/8 family systems essentially worked this way, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    To function on the DECmate, P?S/8 was modified so that there is a new system concept: the "soft ^C" bit. In this specific case, it was defined as bit[11]
    of the memory size word in 007611 to facilitate being set with an ISZ instruction, etc. Here is a reworked piece of code that can function only
    on the newly reworked P?S/8 system:
    </p>
    <p>
      KSF			/FLAG UP?
      JMP	NOT		/FORGET IT
      KRB			/WE MUST READ THE CHARACTER IN
      AND	(177)		/GET RID OF PARITY BIT
      TAD	(-3)		/COMPARE TO ^C
      SZA CLA			/SKIP IF IT MATCHES
      JMP	NOT		/JUMP IF OTHER
    /	DO WHAT'S NEEDED HERE, SUCH AS SET THE DF TO 00, ETC.
      ISZ I	(7611)		/SET THE "^C WAS HIT" BIT
      JMP I	(7600)		/KEYBOARD MONITOR WILL NOTICE THE ^C
    </p>
    <p>
    The keyboard monitor in this case won't have a skipping KSF, but since it also examines bit[11] of 007611, it will notice the abort that way. Thus,
    we have an equivalent of the original code that works on either PDP-8 or DECmate hardware, but only under the new operating system. This code has
    an additional advantage: certain applications run from an alternate device where a user abort can occur, such as another terminal on other than devices
    03/04, etc. This could be a serial printer with a keyboard, or a graphics terminal, etc., where it could be desirable to write an application that
    would have the option of user abort from this alternate device. The program can check for its local abort condition and exit as the replacement console
    routines would above, thus logically extending the operation to the alternate device.
    </p>
    <p>
    OS/8 requires modification to allow a similar abort exit that is as generic.  The keyboard monitor will have to be made sensitive to a new bit, as well as
    responding to a skipping KSF/KRB combination that detects ^C, which will allow compatibility with older programs, but only if the hardware is actually a
    PDP-8 or VT-78, etc. The current candidate is 007601, which is the function word in OS/8's memory save routine that is initiated in 007600. The breakdown
    of that word is:
    </p>
    <p>
    1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    
    ^______________________		Indicates this call is a write function
    
     ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ___________    Indicates that 8 pages should be written out
    
               ^ ^ ^          Indicates that field 00 is to be used
    
                     ^ ^ ^    These bits are usually undefined
    </p>
    <p>
    The use of bits[9-11] of the function word of OS/8 are not defined for any file-structured device with a minor exception: bit[11] being set is optionally
    to be set for the benefit of the existing DECtape/LINCtape handlers to indicate that the caller believes that there is less overhead directing the handler to
    initiate searching for the requested block in the forward direction, whereas the default is to search backwards. Statistically, most searches ought to be
    initiated backwards on these devices because it is likely that the next tape transfer is contiguous to the previous one. However, once the latest transfer
    is completed, it is impossible to restart another transfer without backing up the tape because the latest block has already partially gone by. Thus, in
    practice, the only calls that can benefit are those where the caller needs widely spread out information stored on known blocks that are further apart
    than the overshoot factor of the tape (typically 2-3 blocks must be skipped to make use of an additional forward transfer; the DECtape copy program makes
    use of this feature by only copying half the tape deliberately skipping over many blocks, and then copying only the previously skipped blocks while
    spinning the tape in the reverse direction skipping over the previously copied blocks.)
    </p>
    <p>
    In actual fact, there are only a small handful of static calls within OS/8 that are made with this bit set, due to the design of OS/8 lacking much need
    for the feature of search direction override; the usual OS/8 component isn't forward of the previously read in component, etc. Thus, while a useful feature
    in principle, not much of OS/8 sets the bit because in the static sense, there isn't too much that can be done to predict this situation.
    </p>
    <p>
    Actually, this is unfortunate, since in the dynamic sense, there are quite a few more situations where the actual call could have been made more efficiently
    had the handler been aware of the circumstances which were not told to the handler.
    </p>
    <p>
    In P?S/8, the OS tells the handler nothing at all in this regard, yet overall performance is noticeably better. Part of the reason for this is that in P?S/8
    DECtape handlers, the handler is internally responsible for maintaining the current position of the tape. Any call will be used to determine whether to
    search forward or backwards based solely on the current tape position info obtained from the previous call to the handler.
    </p>
    <p>
    Years ago I wrote such a handler for OS/8 that ignores bit[11] in the function word and instead maintains this "dead reckoning" on its own. If
    interest is warranted, I can locate this code and make it available to the user community. (It is not an exact knee-jerk "clone" of the standard OS/8
    TC01/08 DECtape handler as there are design philosophy differences on other issues as well, but IMHO any user would appreciate the differences and would
    prefer my handler to the standard one.)
    </p>
    <p>
    In any case, it is clear that the following handlers are up for consideration:
    </p>
    <p>
    TC01/08 system and non-system handlers.
    TD8E system and non-system handlers and the TD8E MR-8EC ROM system handler.
    PDP-12 LINCtape handler
    LINC-8 LINCtape hander for a modified LINC-8 and the non-system handler.
    Also the 12K system handler for an unmodified LINC-8 and a possible two-page handler for use as a non-system handler on original hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
    The TC01/08 system consideration was outlined above. The TD8E system handler is also written to obey this bit. Among other considerations already 
    implemented in P?S/8 is the same optimization for search direction on this hardware. It is likely that both the system and non-system handlers can be
    made similarly "smarter". The ROM-based system ignores the bit. The PDP-12 hardware is too complicated to allow the OS/8 handlers to deal with the bit,
    so all transfers are made starting with a reverse search. It is conceivable that the LINC-8 handlers can be made similarly smarter; the modified LINC-8
    hardware includes help-outs to the handler for P?S/8 to accomplish this already, but it isn't clear that the non-system handler for an unmodified machine
    can accomplish this in less than two pages.
    </p>
    <p>
    In any case, it would appear that an adequate job can be done to eradicate the need for this bit in OS/8 completely. The worst-case consequence of the bit
    is that the call to save memory during the exit via 007600 would involve a transfer initiated with a forward search. (And it's conceivable that this
    might even be the proper thing to do!) There are no other OS/8 handlers that pay attention to this bit. (Note, there are non-file-structured devices that
    use these bits; this is irrelevant!)
    </p>
    <p>
    So, a replacement console routine for OS/8 Version 5 would be the same as the P?S/8 example, except that the location being incremented would be
    007601, not 007611. The OS/8 keyboard monitor would have to be made sensitive to bit[11] of 007601 as well as the case of the KSF/KRB skip of a ^C but only
    on PDP-8 hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thus, a replacement OS/8 system can be built for use on PDP-8's or DECmates, but every system program that requires DECmate application must be upgraded
    to the new standard.
    </p>
    <p>
    Along the way, some other issues will be addressed, such as creeping model dependencies, which must be eliminated to allow one system version to run
    on all of the machines it ought to, which is not currently the case in OS/8.  (P?S/8 already has accomplished this: you can carry a single RX01-type 8"
    floppy disk to any appropriately configured machine all the way from a classic 1965 PDP-8 through a DECmate II and boot that very same disk on
    any of the machines.)
    </p>
    <p>
    Next time, more DECmate-specific quirks that impede compatibility due to other problems, etc.

    This is the third in a series of posts about why the DECmate series of small computers is not quite what we know as a PDP-8. Already covered are the minor
    CPU issues, and the significant differences in the console interfaces between all PDP-8s and all DECmates, and what can be done about these particular
    consequences, etc.
    </p>
    <h3>
    3)	Disk issues.
    </h3>
    <p>
    Systems such as OS/8 and P?S/8 have to be configured for whatever machine-specific disk environment they run on, so in theory, this aspect of
    compatibility shouldn't be an issue. However, there are some problematic compatibility details anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
    The DECmate I is essential compatible on this issue, as the boot device of the DECmate I is either an RX01/02 or an RL02. The only actual
    difference between the DECmate I RX interface and a PDP-8 version is that the VT-78-style interface is present, i.e., the software has to deal with
    the potential of two pairs of RX drives. This is controlled by the SEL IOT (6750) which is defined as: load pair select per AC[11] where 0=the drive
    pair found on the PDP-8 and 1=the optional pair found only on the VT-78 or DECmate I (VT-278). Some system handlers for RX do not include the SEL
    instruction to ensure this condition, but it is the default state of the machine. All software, such as the non-system handler to access the second
    pair, is responsible for resetting the select line to ensure the proper functioning of the system handler; it is likely that certain, but not all,
    existing system handlers for RX usage will be so tightly coded that this convention must be obeyed, since this is another tradeoff of features and
    performance versus handler space that could not have been anticipated by the authors of these handlers. There are user-written RX handlers to
    accomplish such things as byte-mode transfers to gain back 33% more disk space over the standard DEC 12-bit mode. There are also handlers to allow
    for accomplishing this with/without the use of the otherwise wasted space on track 0, and also to mimic the disk layout of COS and/or WPS to allow
    conversion programs such as WPFLOP to function. Still others are designed to be able to boot a byte-mode system so that the system device also benefits
    from the additional space, etc. There also exists a set of handlers for use on RT-11-style disk layout to gain faster throughput as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    The overall point here is that there has been a lot of RX work provided by the user community seeking performance beyond what little DEC has provided. By
    switching the "rules" and requiring the software maintain yet another item of "housekeeping" compromises these handlers yet further. (Even in 12-bit mode,
    it is impossible to accomplish all of the requirements of an RX handler in only two pages, the OS/8 upper limit. There exists an analogous handler for
    P?S/8 usage, which requires three pages; P?S/8 allows handlers up to 32 pages long. Thus, any two-page handler is compromised in some way, usually in the
    area of error recovery or performance, possibly only affecting certain models, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
    The DECmate II complicates this issue further. On this specific machine, the RX-78 option allows for one or two pairs of RX01/02 (and at the same time
    prevents the RD51D hard disk option; you can either have one pair of RX50 and a hard disk or up to eight floppies implemented as two pairs of RX01/02 and
    two pairs of RX50). However, the selection interface of the DECmate II is incompatible with that of the VT-78 and DECMate I, and requires several more
    instructions to provide compatible selection with the prior models. Thus, all existing user-written and older DEC-provided handlers cannot run on the
    DECmate II. Only those that can be modified slightly can be made to run on this hardware (which is somewhat more difficult presently than necessary; see
    below).
    </p>
    <p>
    This issue is complicated further by a specific design "philosophy" of OS/278: In OS/8, the RX done flag is used as a status indicator. Assuming no interrupt
    enabled (or the RX device interrupt is specifically disabled; this is in the province of any interrupt-driven program designed for the machine, etc.) the
    done flag being up is used as an idle status indicator. The reason for this is that a handler can never know the current status of the drives when it is
    called; there could be a system reset in progress, which takes up to five seconds to complete. The convention for the handlers is to assume that you
    should wait for the done flag to raise, since it's already up or will be up (eventually) at which time you should proceed with the main work of the
    call. Handler exit is accomplished by executing an innocuous function that cannot fail (such as READ ERROR REGISTER) and then exiting without waiting for
    the function to complete. (The problem is that to test the done flag is to clear it, since the relevant IOT (SDN) is Skip on DoNe set, clear done flag.)
    Thus, the hardware is now in a favorable state for the next caller. Should a power-clear condition occur at some point, the handler will have to wait
    for up to five seconds, but can otherwise proceed, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    When OS/278 was introduced, the new designers revised this convention. Under OS/278, the RX done flag is always assumed to be clear. This sometimes causes
    handlers to fail, or at the least go through some error recovery cycles before accomplishing the requested handler calls, etc. There exists some user 
    programs that make the system crash when run from an OS/278 floppy, while functioning correctly when run from an OS/278 hard disk volume! All of this
    is traceable to bad interaction with the new convention.
    </p>
    <p>
    To operate under this convention will add an undue burden to the handlers written by the user community, and it isn't necessary. I have already written
    P?S/8 handlers that work perfectly fine under the original flag convention on the DECmate II hardware. (I have created a "bootable" RX01/02 P?S/8 system.
    Since the hardware of the DECmate II can only boot to an RX50 or hard disk volume, it is necessary to first boot to the RX50, then run a "re-boot"
    program to bring up the RX01/02-based P?S/8, which is meant to be booted directly on a PDP-8 or VT-78 or DECmate I, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
    OS/8 version 5 will restore the original convention, and thus will require rewriting the DEC-style handlers accordingly. However, all user-written
    handlers will function as intended, i.e., will function only on the PDP-8 system they were designed for. If possible, all handlers should be modified
    to be compatible with the restrictions of all of the machines. (Some of the specific requirements are: 1) Must be able to have decent throughput on the
    slow VT-78; this is often not the case, especially on writes. 2) Must be able to support the SEL hardware of the VT-78/DECmate I, and preferably the
    DECmate II. 3) Should have decent error recovery if possible. In general, it's impossible to have all of this, especially if the format involves the
    use of byte-mode transfers, and the format is single density, thus requiring checking for the possibility of performing byte-mode single density transfers
    on RX02 as opposed to RX01 which programs slightly differently in this mode, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
    In any case, the user-community software investment in RX utility will not go to waste.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the case of the DECmate I, there is only one consideration: the RL8A controller allows for the ability to support existing software for RL01
    or RL02, but not both. There exists a support jumper on the RL8A hardware that prevents some unforeseen consequence from occurring regarding the bit
    normally used in the RL02 for additional seek cylinders, etc. Apparently, the jumper has to be set so that the hardware isn't subject to a mis-set
    bit in the software. Several theories exist as to what the proper setting of this bit is, that the hardware provides to the drives, etc. Possible
    examples are: 1) always one. 2) always zero. 3) Sign extension of the bit immediately to the right of this bit. 4) some form of parity. In any case,
    RL01 software doesn't maintain any consistent usage of this bit, so the hardware jumper is used to maintain compatibility. When the RL02 is used,
    the software correctly uses this (extra) bit. Thus, mixed systems of RL01 and RL02 are not allowed. In theory, if/when we find out what this bit
    setting is, we can possibly modify all of the RL01 software to support an RL01 in a controller where the bit is set for full RL02 support, similar to
    the existing PDP-11 support currently.
    </p>
    <p>
    In any case, RL8A users cannot currently mix RL01 and RL02 drives. The DECmate I RL-278 controller apparently lacks this jumper altogether, thus only allowing
    RL02 drives, until the software clean-up described is implemented. In the case of RL02 software specifically, the DECmate I is fully compatible. (This
    does assume that the software is *otherwise* compatible, such as with the DECmate console interface or CPU differences!)
    </p>
    <p>
    On the DECmate II, III, III+, new software has to be written for the RX50, since the DEC-provided OS/278 handlers instigate the above-mentioned flag
    incompatibility. This should prove as difficult as modifying the user-written handlers, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    DECmate II and III+ hard disk volume software is essentially acceptable, up to a point, since this is the province of these machines only.

    Next time, problems of the RX50 and hard disk volume software not covered yet.
