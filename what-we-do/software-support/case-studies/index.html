								<img src='../../../wp-content/files_mf/casestudy_norfolkcc.png' class="magic_fields" />
								<p>In 1975 I started my OND in Engineering course at Norwich City College. This OND was a general engineering course and at
								that time I was intending to specialise in civil engineering. Part of the course involved a six month industrial placement and
								because of my interest in civil engineering I did this placement with Norfolk County Council in their rural road design
								department at their offices in Martineau Lane.</p>
								<p>I seem to remember my course tutor Mr Jonas being a bit dismissive about this saying that I would spend most of my time
								counting cars! While it was not true that I spent most of my time counting cars I certainly spent some time doing that but
								more on that later.</p>
								<p>I was classed as a Junior Draughtsman and spent most of my time updating various road design drawings that were done on big
								semi-transparent film sheets. The drawing was done with Rotring ink pens.</p>
								<p>Occasionally I did get to go out on surveying jobs that mainly involved me holding a pole for a surveyor to take levels from or
								holding the end of a tape measure.</p>
								<p>The main surveying job I was involved with was surveying the route of the proposed Aylsham bypass. This involved walking through
								several miles of idyllic countryside and musing on the fact that it was soon to be covered in tarmac, but such is progress.</p>
								<p>Another minor part of the role but one that provided some artistic satisfaction was the hand colouring of paper plans with either
								Alizarin Crimson or Hookers Green watercolour, the trick being to ensure uniform shading. Oh, and I was my boss's official
								photocopier. While County Hall was a big building the only photocopier available to us was in a little building the other side
								of the car park. So my boss would appear from his office, mumble, and hand me some papers, I would take them and run to the
								lift (we were on the top floor), go down in the lift, run across the car park, do the photocopying and run back, handing the copies
								to a smiling boss. Actually it’s not true to say I ran, casually sauntered would be more truthful.</p>
								<p>Now every so often there was a traffic survey in some remote town or village and the organiser used to come around asking for
								volunteers. I actually used to like doing this as it got me out of the office for the day and because we had to start early in the
								morning there was overtime money to be made.</p>
								<p>So one day in August in the long hot summer of 1976 I found myself standing by the roadside in some quiet Norfolk village with a
								clipboard in my hand. Now inexplicably there was a French girl standing with me! It was a very hot day and she was wearing jeans
								and a bikini top and it has to be said that the bikini top had its work cut out. The thing is I can’t remotely remember why she was
								there, she certainly wasn’t employed by Norfolk County Council, so I guess she was a student staying with one of the other counters?
								Anyhow we were happily chatting away while I was counting, but after a while I was sure I was counting cars that had already driven
								past. In fact there was a particularly noisy motorbike that came past with a loud noise that receded as it went to the other side
								of the village and then got louder as it came back for another ride past! It did this three or four times, once we realised what was
								happening the French girl and I just smiled. So if you’re ever driving through a remote Norfolk village that has an improbably wide
								road leading into it this is because of our skewed data.</p>

							<h3 class="blue">Eastern Gas</h3>
							<span class="more-less">More</span><hr class="green" />
                            <div class="profile restrict-height">
								<img src='../../../wp-content/files_mf/casestudy_easterngas.png' class="magic_fields" />
								<p>In 1977 after completing my OND I joined Eastern Gas initially working at their office on Roundtree Way. At this time because of the
								demand for natural gas the gas board was expanding and they took on several new engineering staff. I think I was an
								Engineering Assistant who was junior to an Assistant Engineer - it took me a while to realise I was the most junior of the two.</p>
								<p>Engineering wise the gas board was divided into three departments, these being transmission, distribution and home. I was in the distribution
								department that was responsible for the gas mains in the streets and the service pipes up to the gas meter.</p>
								<p>I did initially follow an apprentice type route in that I spent time working in various departments such as network planning, billing,
								purchasing, stores, drawing office, workshop, and leak detection, but most time was spent in my home distribution engineering department.</p>
								<p>Normal activities would include measuring up for new or replacement gas service pipes, standing in for supervisors who may have been on
								holiday or sick, and this meant directly supervising the workmen doing the actual work. At that time there was much wholesale relaying of old
								gas mains and this would have meant visiting each house on a road to explain what was being done and arrange to have their service replaced.
								There was also a certain amount of liaison with other service providers to be done for which we had to put out notices. And there was always
								a lot of paperwork to be created or checked through.</p>
								<p>However, being the most junior staff engineer meant that I got lots of miscellaneous jobs to do. I realised later that I was asked to do
								these odd jobs because my manager daren’t ask anyone else. Well obviously there was an army of workmen but if asked to do anything other than
								their assigned role they would always be concerned about how it would affect their bonus and this made it difficult. Of course there were other
								staff engineers but then they were all more senior to me and I suppose older. Having said that there were other Engineering Assistants and I’m
								sure they did their share of the dirty work.</p>
								<p>Buying sheets of rubber, taking items to a local grocers to be weighed as they had extra large scales, going to the police to get a policeman
								to ask someone to move their car, various paperwork sorting exercises, clambouring in an old gas board building cellar trying to trace a
								mysterious pipe with my boss calling down “have you found it yet”. Ah happy days.</p>
								<p>The oddest job was when I was working in Cremorne Lane for a while where there was a nut and bolt store probably about the size of a double
								garage. Unfortunately this building was suffering from subsidence and needed demolishing, but it was stuffed full of chunky nuts and bolts and
								these needed sorting and moving. My boss said it’s a dirty job but someones got to do it. Anyhow that must have taken me a week or two. On
								reflection I think I just did the sorting and he got someone else stronger to move them.</p>
								<p>Of course I did make some mistakes. There was a road in the village of Watton where we were going to relay the main. I went round each house
								explaining what was to be done and arranging for their service pipe to be relaid. Most of the houses were at a set distance not far from the road
								but one house was set a lot further back with a rose garden in front. I remember the owner didn’t seem pleased when I explained that we needed to
								dig a trench through his garden. Now a normal service pipe would have been 25mm in diameter and this is what was used for all the houses in this
								road. Unfortunately for long service pipes a larger 32mm pipe diameter needed to be used and the set back house just fell into this category. I
								realised this after it was done and unfortunately my boss spotted it and insisted it needed to be redone. This did cause a bit of trouble but
								the worst bit for me was having to go back to the house and explain to the owner that we needed to dig his rose garden up again. Strangely he
								seemed more resigned to it the second time!</p>
								<p>When working at Thetford I was asked to book a coach to take all the workmen to the Norwich depot for a union meeting, this was to save them
								having to use their lorries, and the coach needed to be there at 7am. Now I drove to Thetford from Norwich every morning more around 8am and on
								this particular morning I was about halfway when I spotted a convoy of gas board lorries heading towards me. My heart sank as I knew my booking
								had gone wrong and was going to have to face my boss as soon as I arrived at work. I’ll skip over my reception, but I quickly got onto the coach
								company. Of course they had it down for 7pm - did I still want the coach they asked?</p>
								<p>One last anecdote probably typical of the 70s that I can’t imagine happening now. A couple of leak detection specialists had come to Norwich to test our
								gas mains and this meant following the path of each main on foot with some gas detector device. I was assigned to one of these men for the day and
								we started off in the morning following gas mains and as it got to lunchtime he said he was meeting his colleague in a city centre pub for lunch
								and did I want to come. Well it would have a bit difficult to say no as I was in his van miles from anywhere but anyhow I wasn’t adverse to the
								idea of a pub. So we drove into the city centre and I thought he’d look for somewhere to park but no, he just stopped on the side of Cattle Market Street, one of the
								busiest roads in the city centre, put on the flashing indicators and a sign in the window saying we were investigating a gas leak. So we got out and went to the pub,
								the Pig & Whistle, where we met his colleague who asked what we wanted. Well pints all round, they went down quickly and so my companion asked
								what we wanted, well pints all round of course. I thought two pints at lunchtime was probably enough but felt compelled to offer to buy a round,
								well this was eagerly accepted and then somewhat to my surprise the first person offered to buy another round and we couldn’t refuse. So after
								four pints we walked back to the van having finished our “leak investigation” and went back to work! Thinking about it I don't recall having any
								food - surely it being the 70s we should have had a basket meal at least</p>
