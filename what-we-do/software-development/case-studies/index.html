									<p>This project is the creation of a new Java application to generate CPI/RPI indices. The system architecture is based around the combination of an Oracle
									database and Weblogic application server with the use of Spring and JPA/Hibernate providing the framework for the software implementation. The web interface
									uses JSF/Primefaces and has also involved the use of XHTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. PL/SQL stored procedures have been used to implement certain of the
									algorithms. The project is managed in an agile manner with daily Scrum meetings. I have worked on most aspects of this project.</p>

									<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority, a non-ministerial department which reports directly
									to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</p>
									
									<p>It is charged with the collection and publication of statistics related to the economy, population and society of England and Wales at national, regional and
									local levels. It functions as the executive office of the National Statistician, who is also the UK Statistics Authority's Chief Executive and principal
									statistical adviser to the UK's National Statistics Institute and the 'Head Office' of the Government Statistical Service (GSS). Its main office is in
									Newport near the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office and Tredegar House, but another significant office is in Titchfield in Hampshire, and a small
									office is in London. ONS co-ordinates data collection with the respective bodies in Northern Ireland and Scotland, namely NISRA and NRS.</p>
									
									<h4>History</h4>
									<p>The ONS was formed on 1 April 1996 by the merger of the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS).
									Following the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the United Kingdom Statistics Authority became a non-ministerial department on the 1 April 2008.</p>
									
									<h4>Purpose and scope</h4>
									<p>ONS produces and publishes a wide range of the information about Britain that can be used for social and economic policy-making as well as painting a portrait
									of the country as its population evolves over time. This is often produced in ways that make comparison with other societies and economies possible. Much of
									the data on which policy-makers depend is produced by ONS through a combination of a decennial population census, samples and surveys and analysis of data
									generated by businesses and organisations such as the National Health Service and the register of births, marriages and deaths. Both its publications and
									its publicly available raw data, available free, are reported and discussed daily in the media as the basis for the public understanding of the country in
									which they live.</p>
									
									<h4>Applications of data</h4>
									<p>The reliance on some of these data by government (both local and national) makes ONS material central to debates about the determination of priorities, the
									allocation of resources and for decisions on interest rates or borrowing. The complexity and degree and speed of change in the society, combined with the
									challenge of measuring some of these (e.g. in relation to longevity, migration or illness patterns or fine movements in inflation or other aspects of national
									accounts) give rise to periodic debates about some of its indicators and portrayals. Many of these rely on sources which are outside of ONS, while some of its
									own sources need to be supplemented, for example between censuses, by updated but less rigorously obtained information from other sources. Consequently,
									unexpected or incomplete data or occasional errors or disputes about its analysis can also attract considerable attention.
									ONS data can also be used in epidemiologic studies such as survival analysis.</p>

									<p>This project was the satellite modem for the Skynet 5 communication system. The modem architecture was a version of the CORBA &amp; XML based JTRS SCA
									framework for software-defined radios. Our consultants first role was working on the modem Restricted Control Processor (RCP) written in Java. Our
									consultant implemented the satellite synchronisation software that enabled the use of CDMA type waveforms, incorporating algorithms defined by the Systems
									group. Our consultant performed top-level design in Rational Rose UML with coding in Java. The target system was cPCI running real-time Linux.</p>
									
									<p>Our consultants second role was working on the Java terminal management application – this used Swing GUI components, and ran as a Windows service. This
									controlled a set of modems via JMS messaging and a large part of his work on this project involved writing security and key handling software - and
									XML message handling using JAXB. Here UML was used for design with coding in Java J2SE 1.5 using Eclipse. The project used Agile-programming
									techniques with Scrum management. Test driven development and the tools Subversion, JUnit, JMock, CruiseControl, Cobertura &amp; Ant were used.
									JNI was used to access C++ interfaces.</p>
									
									<p>Next-generation satellites for military communications services. Astrium is prime contractor for the design and build of the complete Skynet 5 system.
									Under the Skynet 5 Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract signed in October 2003 and extended in March 2010, the UK MOD is procuring satellite
									communications services from Astrium Services up to at least 2022.</p>
									
									<p>Astrium is prime contractor for the design and build of the complete Skynet 5 system. This comprises four Skynet 5 spacecraft as well as a major upgrade
									of the fixed terrestrial infrastructure, networks and management systems in the UK and provision of over 160 satellite communications terminals. Skynet 5A
									was launched in March 2007, 5B in November 2007, and 5C in June 2008. Skynet 5D is under production.</p>
									
									<p>The Skynet 5 satellites are based on the new high-power E3000 variant of Astrium’s well-proven Eurostar series which has accumulated over 400 years’
									operational life. Each Skynet 5 spacecraft has a launch mass of around 5 tonnes, compared to 1.6 tonnes for Skynet 4F, and a payload power of 5kW, up to
									four times the power of Skynet 4.</p>
									
									<p>The Skynet 5 system provides reliable secure voice and data communications for combined-operations in peacekeeping and under battlefield conditions. UK Armed
									Forces and other government organisations will benefit from regional steerable spot beams. The technologically advanced, fully-hardened Skynet 5 satellites
									carry advanced UHF and SHF communications payloads with 15 active channels and extensive channel-to-beam flexibility, as well as multiple antennas for global
									and regional beams.</p>
									
									<p>The ground systems being delivered by Astrium as part of the Skynet 5 programme include 59 Reacher tactical vehicle-mounted units in various configurations,
									capable of standing up to the rigours of all-terrain transport and operation in harsh environments.</p>

									<p>The Symbian/Epoc OS is licensed by a number of mobile phone manufacturers for use in their handsets, e.g. Nokia. Our consultants role here was as part
									of the core development group within the networking and telephony team. His initial role was defect removal. He was then engaged in the implementation
									of security enhancements within the socket, TCP/IP stack, and SMS/WAP stack code. All coding was in C++ with Perl being used to modify test harnesses.
									Target platforms were an emulator running under Windows NT and Arm4 boards running the Symbian OS natively. Development was done using VisualStudio and
									Metrowerks CodeWarrior.</p>
									
									<p>Symbian is an open-source (EPL) mobile operating system (OS) and computing platform designed for smartphones and currently maintained by Accenture.
									Symbian was originally developed by Symbian Ltd., as a descendant of Psion's EPOC and runs exclusively on ARM processors, although an unreleased x86
									port existed. The current form of Symbian is an open-source platform developed by Symbian Foundation in 2009, as the successor of the original Symbian OS.
									Symbian was used by many major mobile phone brands, like Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and above all by Nokia. It was the most popular smartphone OS
									on a worldwide average until the end of 2010, when it was overtaken by Android.
									Symbian rose to fame from its use with the S60 platform built by Nokia, first released in 2002 and powering most Nokia smartphones. UIQ, another Symbian
									platform, ran in parallel, but these two platforms were not compatible with each other. Symbian^3, was officially released in Q4 2010 as the successor of
									S60 and UIQ, first used in the Nokia N8, to use a single platform for the OS. In May 2011 an update, Symbian Anna, was officially announced, followed by
									Nokia Belle (previously Symbian Belle) in August 2011.
									On 11 February 2011, Nokia announced that it would use Microsoft's Windows Phone OS as its primary smartphone platform, and Symbian will be its franchise
									platform, dropping Symbian as its main smartphone OS of choice. On 22 June 2011 Nokia made an agreement with Accenture for
									an outsourcing program. Accenture will provide Symbian-based software development and support services to Nokia through 2016; about 2,800 Nokia employees

										<p>The Nokia N8 is a touchscreen-based smartphone developed by Nokia. The Nokia N8 was the first device to run on
										the Symbian^3 mobile operating system and Nokia's flagship device of 2010.</p>

										<h4 class="blue">Symbian Architecture</h4>
										
										<h5>Symbian kernel</h5>
										<p>
										The Symbian kernel (EKA2) supports sufficiently fast real-time response to build a single-core phone around it—that is, a phone in which a
										single processor core executes both the user applications and the signalling stack. The real-time kernel has a microkernel architecture
										containing only the minimum, most basic primitives and functionality, for maximum robustness, availability and responsiveness. It has been
										termed a nanokernel, because it needs an extended kernel to implement any other abstractions. It contains a scheduler, memory management
										and device drivers, with networking, telephony and file system support services in the OS Services Layer or the Base Services Layer. The
										inclusion of device drivers means the kernel is not a true microkernel.
										</p>
										
										<h5>Design</h5>
										<p>
										Symbian features pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection, like other operating systems (especially those created for use on desktop
										computers). EPOC's approach to multitasking was inspired by VMS and is based on asynchronous server-based events.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										Symbian OS was created with three systems design principles in mind:
										</p>
										
										<ul>
											<li>The integrity and security of user data is paramount</li>
											<li>User time must not be wasted</li>
											<li>All resources are scarce</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>
										To best follow these principles, Symbian uses a microkernel, has a request-and-callback approach to services, and maintains separation
										between user interface and engine. The OS is optimised for low-power battery-based devices and for ROM-based systems (e.g. features like
										XIP and re-entrancy in shared libraries). Applications, and the OS itself, follow an object-oriented design: Model-view-controller (MVC).
										</p>
										
										<p>
										Later OS iterations diluted this approach in response to market demands, notably with the introduction of a real-time kernel and a platform
										security model in versions 8 and 9.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										There is a strong emphasis on conserving resources which is exemplified by Symbian-specific programming idioms like descriptors and a
										cleanup stack. Similar methods exist to conserve storage space. Further, all Symbian programming is event-based, and the central processing
										unit (CPU) is switched into a low power mode when applications are not directly dealing with an event. This is done via a programming idiom
										called active objects. Similarly the Symbian approach to threads and processes is driven by reducing overheads.
										</p>
										
										<h5>Operating system</h5>
										<p>
										The All over Model contains the following layers, from top to bottom:
										</p>
										
										<ul>
											<li>UI Framework Layer</li>
											<li>Application Services Layer</li>
											<li>Java ME</li>
											<li>OS Services Layer</li>
											<li>Generic OS services</li>
											<li>Communications services</li>
											<li>Multimedia and graphics services</li>
											<li>Connectivity services</li>
											<li>Base Services Layer</li>
											<li>Kernel Services and Hardware Interface Layer</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>
										The Base Services Layer is the lowest level reachable by user-side operations; it includes the File Server and User Library, a Plug-In
										Framework which manages all plug-ins, Store, Central Repository, DBMS and cryptographic services. It also includes the Text Window Server
										and the Text Shell: the two basic services from which a completely functional port can be created without the need for any higher layer
										services.
										</p>
										
										<p>										
										Symbian has a microkernel architecture, which means that the minimum necessary is within the kernel to maximise robustness, availability
										and responsiveness. It contains a scheduler, memory management and device drivers, but other services like networking, telephony and
										filesystem support are placed in the OS Services Layer or the Base Services Layer. The inclusion of device drivers means the kernel is
										not a true microkernel. The EKA2 real-time kernel, which has been termed a nanokernel, contains only the most basic primitives and requires
										an extended kernel to implement any other abstractions.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										Symbian is designed to emphasise compatibility with other devices, especially removable media file systems. Early development of EPOC led to
										adopting FAT as the internal file system, and this remains, but an object-oriented persistence model was placed over the underlying FAT to
										provide a POSIX-style interface and a streaming model. The internal data formats rely on using the same APIs that create the data to run all
										file manipulations. This has resulted in data-dependence and associated difficulties with changes and data migration.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										There is a large networking and communication subsystem, which has three main servers called: ETEL (EPOC telephony), ESOCK (EPOC sockets) and
										C32 (responsible for serial communication). Each of these has a plug-in scheme. For example, ESOCK allows different ".PRT" protocol modules to
										implement various networking protocol schemes. The subsystem also contains code that supports short-range communication links, such as Bluetooth,
										IrDA and USB.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										There is also a large volume of user interface (UI) Code. Only the base classes and substructure were contained in Symbian OS, while most of the
										actual user interfaces were maintained by third parties. This is no longer the case. The three major UIs — S60, UIQ and MOAP — were contributed
										to Symbian in 2009. Symbian also contains graphics, text layout and font rendering libraries.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										All native Symbian C++ applications are built up from three framework classes defined by the application architecture: an application class, a
										document class and an application user interface class. These classes create the fundamental application behaviour. The remaining needed functions,
										the application view, data model and data interface, are created independently and interact solely through their APIs with the other classes.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										Many other things do not yet fit into this model — for example, SyncML, Java ME providing another set of APIs on top of most of the OS and
										multimedia. Many of these are frameworks, and vendors are expected to supply plug-ins to these frameworks from third parties (for example,
										Helix Player for multimedia codecs). This has the advantage that the APIs to such areas of functionality are the same on many phone models,
										and that vendors get a lot of flexibility. But it means that phone vendors needed to do a great deal of integration work to make a Symbian
										OS phone.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										Symbian includes a reference user-interface called "TechView." It provides a basis for starting customisation and is the environment in which
										much Symbian test and example code runs. It is very similar to the user interface from the Psion Series 5 personal organiser and is not used
										for any production phone user interface.
										</p>

									<p>This role was a continuation of earlier work at Racal on 3G/CDMA/UMTS analyser systems. It included the adaptation of Tx/Rx (TRx) C++ software such that it would run
									on multiple hardware configurations; an abstract factory design pattern being introduced to instantiate classes controlling device variants. Our consultant
									upgraded a VxWorks BSP for a proprietary ATM card, this included writing an I2O device driver for the PCI bridge, this driver being incorporated into the
									VxWorks enhanced network driver stack. The ATM card allowed connection to a Node B landline interface. He was also engaged in defect removal from existing
									software used to control the UMTS Layer 1 devices. Design was done with Rational Rose UML, most code was C++, apart from updates to a Visual Basic debug
									program that operated through the targets COM interface.</p>

									<p>Racal Electronics plc was once the third-largest British electronics firm.
									Listed on the London Stock Exchange and once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, Racal was a diversified company, offering products including: as
									voice and data recorders; point of sale terminals; laboratory instruments; military electronics, including radio and radar. At its height, it operated
									throughout 110 countries world-wide and employed over 30,000 people. It was the parent company of Vodafone, before the mobile telephony provider was
									sold in 1991.</p>
									
									<p>Racal was purchased by Thomson-CSF (now Thales Group) in 2000, thereby giving the French firm access to the lucrative UK defence and armaments market.</p>

									<p>This project was a command &amp; control information C2IS management system written in Java. The server architecture was based around an Oracle 10g RDBMS
									and Oracle J2EE Application Server with functionality exposed via WSDL specified web services using SOAP messaging. The aim being to provide a full
									service-orientated architecture (SOA). Client interfaces were implemented using web pages composed of portlets. I designed an import/export web service
									with the service layer specified in BPEL and programmed server-side bean components interfacing with the database via SQL and JDBC. I designed a Java
									Swing applet controlled from Javascript to allow file management from client web pages. Software was designed in UML using Telelogic Rhapsody and coded
									in Java using Oracle JDeveloper. Development was controlled using Rational unified change management (UCM) with ClearCase &amp; ClearQuest. DOORS was used
									for requirements.</p>
									
									<p>The Headquarters of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corp (ARRC) had a requirement to replace some 30 plus bespoke CIS systems on their existing business network
									and replace their whole static and deployable networks and CIS applications with a single network/platform solution.
									The bid team for the ARRC C2IS which saw Thales UK Ltd, Computer Science Corporation and Raytheon entering into a joint partnership to provide a solution
									to the requirement. The bid consisted of a team of more than thirty and lasted three months. The contract was won and the project went on to be a
									significant success opening up a new business line for Thales.</p>

									<p>
									The Allied Rapid Reaction Corps Command and Control Information System (ARRC C2IS) is designed to form the information backbone in deployed NATO
									headquarters. The system will consist of battle management and information sharing tools that will provide commanders with enhanced situational
									awareness and coalition networking interoperability.

									<p>Our consultant worked on the implementation of a prototype system for airborne automatic real-time low altitude mission planning. The system was VME based
									with multiple PPCs running VxWorks. Code was written in C/C++.</p>
									
									<p>The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (normally known as DERA) was a part of the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) until July 2, 2001. At the time it was
									the United Kingdom's largest science and technology organisation. DERA was split into two organisations: short-lived transition bodies known as PDERA
									("privatised" DERA) which became a commercial firm, QinetiQ, and "RDERA" (meaning "retained" in Government DERA) which became the Defence Science and
									Technology Laboratory (Dstl).</p>
									At the split, QinetiQ was formed from the majority (about 3/4 of the staff and most of the facilities) of DERA, with Dstl assuming responsibility for those
									aspects which were best done in government. A few examples of the work undertaken by Dstl include nuclear, chemical, and biological research. In the time
									since the split both organisations have undergone significant change programmes. QinetiQ has increased its focus on overseas research with a number of US
									and other foreign acquisitions, whereas Dstl has a major rationalisation programme aimed at changing many aspects of its operations.
									DERA was formed in April 1995 as an amalgamation of the following organisations:
									Defence Research Agency (DRA) which was set up in April 1991 and comprised the Royal Aerospace Establishment (RAE); Admiralty Research Establishment (ARE);
									Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE); and, Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE)
									Defence Test and Evaluation Organisation (DTEO)
									Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment (CBDE at Porton Down), which became part of the Protection and Life Sciences Division (PLSD)
									Centre for Defence Analysis (CDA).</p>
									<p>The chief executive throughout DERA's existence was John Chisholm. DERA's staffing level was around 9000 scientists, technologists and support staff.</p>
