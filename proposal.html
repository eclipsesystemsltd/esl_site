<h1>Response To A Request For Proposal</h1>
<h2>The Proposal</h2>
The proposal is the set of documents submitted by the vendor organisations against the RFP. Normally two documents are submitted as a proposal, these being:
<ul>
    <li>Technical Proposal</li>
    <li>Financial Proposal</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible that the two could be merged into one, but many professional organisations insist on two-bid proposals so that the technical aspects can be
separated from financial considerations. The principle organisation would evaluate all technical proposals and select the ones that best meet their technical requirements.
Then, they would open the corresponding financial proposals and select the lowest financial bid among them. The problem is that the process is often not so straightforward. In 
these days of monopolistic competition, vendors propose different types of technical solutions to show that their offering is superior to others. For the same needs, one 
vendor may offer a cloud based solution, another an in-house server option or some combination. All will say that their solution meets the organisations needs effectively. This 
makes it difficult to compare different technical solutions on an even footing. Each value proposition is assessed, based on the combination of technical and financial bids, and 
the vendor offering the best value is selected. In cases where the decision is still not clear, negotiations may be carried out to clarify issues and arrive at the best alternative.</p>

<p>The technical bid proposal, being the first to be opened and evaluated, is crucial for the vendor to win. Unless the technical bid meets or exceeds the specifications set by 
the RFP, the financial bid would not even be opened.</p>

<p>The following sections should be part of a technical proposal:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Preamble: This would be similar to the preamble of the RFP. Additionally, information about the vendors organisation would also be included, highlighting its history, specialisms, 
        and experience in the relevant field.</li>
    <li>Scope of work: The scope of work as offered would be described here. This section should normally be identical to the scope of work described in the RFP. Sometimes, the 
        offering may not be exactly identical to what is requested. Therefore, this section describes the scope of work as offered. What is stated here is what will be delivered. We 
        need to understand clearly what is asked for and then explain what is offered to ensure that the client can correlate their needs with the offering and agree that the specifications 
        are met.</li>
    <li>Approach and methodology: The approach to the assignment and methodology for executing it are explained here. International, national, and industry guidelines and internal 
        consulting firm quality standards should be included if necessary. The project execution life cycle is explained so that the customer understands the approach to the 
        project and its execution to ensure success. This section should also contain the procedure for handling change requests placed by the principle.</li>
    <li>Responsibilities: Vendors need to clearly delineate the responsibilities in the project activities between customer and vendor and enumerate all activities as part of the 
        proposal. There are three levels of reponsibilities - the principals, the vendor's, and the shared (primary/secondary) between the principal and vendor:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes the responsibility needs to be shared equally between the principal and the vendor</li>
            <li>Sometimes the principal would have primary reponsibility with the vendor having secondary (e.g. approvals)</li>
            <li>Sometimes the vendor would have primary reponsibility and the principal secondary (e.g. raising invoices for payment)</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Assumptions: This would include support needed from the customer. Vendors need to enumerate all the assumptions made in preparing the proposal. If the project execution 
        needs any support from the principle it is included here. Certainly the vendor needs support in terms of entry, common facilities, approvals, and so on from the principal. All 
        these aspects need to be included in the proposal.</li>
    <li>Schedule of project execution: The proposal needs to include the schedule of project execution. A very detailed schedule is not necessary but major milestones need to be included 
        in the proposal</li>
    <li>Terms and conditions: What constitutes the technical success of the project belongs here. There can also be a number of things that can go wrong technically to affect project 
        execution, including a disruption in supplies, supplied equipment being different than planned, sites not being ready due to delays in other contractors work, and so on. These 
        need to be included in this section.</li>
    <li>Exclusions: Sometimes the RFP can be confusing and the scope of work described in the foregoing sections may leave some ambiguity. All such ambiguities need to be spelled 
        out here. This is done by enumerating the exclusions from the project. Consequential liability is applicable in countries like the United States but not say in India. If the 
        contracts span across countries this issue needs to be noted very carefully. Whatever is part of the scope of work and not included in the exclusions list would be deemed to 
        be included. So, vendors need to exercise diligence in describing the scope of work and exclusions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The financial proposal would contain the following sections:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Professional Fee: This section would indicate the professional fee or charges for executing the assignment. It may be a single figure or an itemised set of figures for all the 
        services provided. It depends on the requirements of the principal or the practices of the vendor organisation. This would be the sum of money the principal needs to pay in 
        addition to items that will be charged at their actual cost to the principal.</li>
    <li>Items billed at actual cost: There are a number of things that would be billed at their actual cost (e.g. travel, supply of specialised high cost equipment, etc.) Vendors need 
        to list all such items in this section, and include the procedure for determining and billing for work carried out against change requests placed by the principal.</li>
    <li>Methodology for billing: In long, drawn out projects, it is common to periodically bill for services rendered by the vendors. Sometimes it is based on measuring the work 
        completed and sometimes it is by the reaching of a milestone. Whatever methodology will be used for submitting bills needs to be submitted here.</li>
    <li>Payment schedule: The schedule of payments expected by the vendor needs to be included in this section. It may include an advance required to mobilise resources for executing 
        the project and the periodic bills that would follow.</li>
    <li>Taxes: It needs to be made explicitly clear if the project is eligible for taxation. The tax rate and whether it is included in the professional fee or would separately be 
        billed should be included in this section. Although taxes are an item to be billed at actual cost, vendors still need to separately deal with them because it is not a cost 
        item but an amount that has to be paid to a government entity.</li>
    <li>Penalties: Explicitly mention two items in this section:
        <ul>
            <li>Whether penalties proposed by the principal are accepted/rejected by the vendor.</li>
            <li>Any penalties for delayed payments by the principal.</li>
        </ul>
        If not mentioned here, the principal cannot be asked to pay interest on delayed payments.</li>
    <li>Price escalation: For long drawn out projects, a price escalation is very likely due to inflation or other reasons. If vendors need to raise their prices to neutralise the 
        impact of price escalation during the course of project execution, it needs to be mentioned here along with criteria for when the price escalation becomes applicable.</li>
    <li>Issue escalation: An escalation mechanism to resolve disputes should be included. Usually this starts with senior executives but could go to an arbitrator or even the courts
        if the dispute is serious.</li>
    <li>Force Majeure: This section describes the actions when things beyond vendor control, such as floods, fires, strikes, wars, and natural calamities, disrupt operations and 
        prevent the fulfilling of the contract. It would include the waiting period before taking action, the remedies available, any penalties that could be levied, etc.</li>
    <li>Validity period: The period for which the amounts quoted in this proposal are valid and a timeframe for finalising the proposal. If the decision is delayed beyond the time 
        limit set in this section, the principal needs to obtain a fresh financial proposal.</li>
    <li>Other terms and conditions: Each vendor organisation may have a host of other miscellaneous terms and conditions included in the proposal. These would contain the use of 
        customer names in marketing collaterals, disclosure of information contained in the proposal, non-solicitation of staff, confidentiality clauses, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The proposal is a very important aspect of project acquisition and when the project is awarded it will be the primary document for reference in any legal matters, along with the RFP, 
    purchase order, and the acceptance letter of the purchase order documents. Therefore, careful diligence must be exercised when preparing the proposal. Normally a senior management 
    committee reviews and approves the proposal before it is submitted to the customer.</p>
